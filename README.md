# SimScape-Electrical-Real-Time
Contains realistic power systems models made with SimScape Electrical, ready for parallel execution in real-time.
Also contain HDL Coder ready models for execution on FPGA.

Since January 2026, the toolbox previously known as SimPowerSystems is not supported anymore by Mathworks.
The global objective of this repository is to provide user with equivalent power systems models in the native SimScape Electrical for Simulink.

SimScape Electrical was not designed by power systems engineers (as it is part of a much more general simulation tool) and lacks of some expertise in models, components and methods.
SimPowerSystems in contrast was made with real-time and power systems in mind by Hydro-Quebec.

Nevertheless, SimScape Electrical is a really powerful toolbox, only lacking some twists to make it dominent in the industry. The SimScape solver engine is a general multi-domain solver and is very similar to a nodal admittance solver like EMTP.

In this repository, we find:

- realistic power systems models, actually inspired by the SimPowerSystems in some case, often ready for real-time deployment in SpeedGoat using concurrent and parallel task processing: HVDC thyristor, HVDC-MMC, etc...
  
- some optimized model for real-time such as: half-bridge MMC, inverter switching functions, realistic decoupling elements such decouping distributed parameter lines.
  
- some very useful blocks for everyday modeling like configuable RLC block WITH MATCHING ICONS or unbalanced 3-phase RLC loads.

- Some model specifically designed for FPGA and HDL Coder (in /FPGA)

- MATE_SOCS: the Solver-on-Chip is an innovative FPGA solver that is topologically reconfigurable to avoid bitstream generation each time the circuit is modified.

NEW: You can browse my different models easily by using the MATEModelSelector Matlab App! Models can be open, help found (some are missing but I am filling the gaps!)

I don't have a SpeedGoat simulator so if you want to test the model and report the performance, that would be great. It is also possible to port them to other RTDS with some skills.

Folder description:
Documentation/  contains various reading for real-time simulation aficionado. Read the MATE-SOCS article, nice!

MATE: main Simulink library and associated files. Put in your MATLAB path to use the other models.
MATE/slx/simetranss.slx: my dream library of models. For example, a unified configurable RLC series/parallel block with matching icon.
Note: if some models accidentally point to simetran.slx library (my first library), the corresponding model can be found in simetranss.slx.

Converter_MultiWinding_9LevelCascadedH-Bridge: a high power converter using shifted multi-winding transformer on the feeder to minimize grid harmonics and 9 level cascaded H-bridge 3-phase inverter. Optimimized for real-time implementation, with decoupled DC stages.

HVDC-MMC-200cellsPerArms: a full HVDC MMC bipolar link with distributed parameter lines with detailed optimized 200 cells per arms MMC model. Ready for concurent/parallel execution on SpeedGoat, using 4 different tasks.

HVDC_bipolar_Thyristor: a full HVDC bipolar link with distributed parameter lines, switched filter/reactive power compensation banks. Ready for concurent/parallel execution on SpeedGoat, using 4 different tasks.

NetworkDecouplingTechnique: The IEEE 13 node feeder SimScape model is used to demonstrate proper ways to decouple power system equation with the use of stublines and stublines transformer. The model and various techniques are explained in more details in MATE/doc/MATE_StublineHowTo.pdf

Stublines are Bergeron Line model with losses adjusted to have exactly one-time setp of propagation delay.
Stubline are commonly used in real-time simulators with power transformer. By replacing the secondary leakeage
inductances with stublines, one obtains an accurate point of decoupling for the grid equations.

DistributionGrids: Using the techniques of /NetworkDecouplingTechnique, distribution grid models are presented here.
List of models: IEEE 123 node test feeder model.

OversampledPowerConverters/ Explains how to simulate high-frequency PWM converter with oversampling of IGBT/GTO/MOSFET gate signal. In the model, the 2-level inverter feed a 3-phase RL load with back-EMF. Sample time is 30 us and the PWM frequency is 3 kHz. However, the accuracy of the simulation is equivalent to a 2 us sample time, why? Because of oversampling and averaging of the gate pulses. In real-time simulator, this resolution can go as low as 10 nanoseconds with FPGA boards. The model is explained in more details in MATE/doc/MATE_OversamplingPowerConverters.pdf

Machines/: contain many machine types (Synchronous, induction) designed with constant Jacobian (admittance), best for real-time simulation because the SimScape solver do not need to refactorize its equations for these node (assuming that the SimScape solver can optimally order its nodes).

FPGA/: In this folder will be found models suitable for FPGA simulation and HDL Coder. These models contains only Pejovic switches and Switching Function Inverters with full rectification and high impedance mode support.
NOTE: /FPGA contains model that are expected to convert Simspace Electric models into FPGA. But HDL Coder has many little issues and the produced HDL code is not easy to control. Example: HDL Coder adds some delays between the Simscape Eletrical and pure Simulink parts, so my switch models don't work anymore.

In /MATE_SOCS, this problem is solved by converting the Simscape Electrical models into a state-space model (with only the D matrix non-empty). The model generated this way are more easily controlled and produce the expectd result because  HDL Coder see only a pure Simulink model.

List of models in FPGA/:

    - Basic Pejovic switch test model
    
    - Single-phase 2-level inverter with RL load, made with Pejovic switches and compensated for switching losses.
    
    - MATE_PMSMDynamicSwitches.slx : complete PMSM drive with compensated Pejovic switches (also called Dynamic Switch)
         This demo is derived from https://www.mathworks.com/help/hdlcoder/ug/generate-hdl-code-for-simscape-models-using-dynamic-switch-approximation.html
         Using compensated Dynamic Switches results in very accurate DC current simulation. By comparison, the original demo is completely innacurate for Idc (you need to add the current sensor at the battery). Accurate DC current are important in battery management systems. 
         Without compensation, the battery will see a greater energy outflow. This is the well-known problem spurious power losses of the Pejovic method. The power losses will increase with the PWM frequency. See reference section, IECON paper.
         
     - MATE_PermanentMagnetSynchronousMachine.slx: complete 9 kHZ PMSM Drive with AC-link rectifier. The inverter is a switching function with rectification capability and fixed admittance. The PMSM motor is of unprecedented formulation with the constant part of the mutual inductance directly into the SimScape solver. It also have a fixed admittance as seen by the main SimScape DAE solver. See /MATE/doc for the PMSM equations.
     The complete model is designed to be compatible with HDL Coder without modifications as all components have fixed admittance.

     -MATE_SwitchedReluctanceMotor64Drive.slx: complete SRM drive with switching functions. Extremely accurate and HDL Coder ready.

     -MATEInductionMachineDTC.slx: complete induction machine with direct torque control made with Pejovic compensated switches and Fixed referential IM, therefore well-suited for HDL coder.
     
     -MATE_3level_DriveOversampling.slx: a simple 3-level NPC drive with time-step averaging/high-impedance capable switching function. The model includes all common topology cases: w/wo neutral return, w/wo floating back-EMF source, battery disconnect, rectification, etc...

     More info in readme of the /FPGA section
     
         
Pejovic switches offer the advantage of having a constant admittance in both ON and OFF position. This constant admittance avoid the need for refactorisation of nodal equation (or state-space permutation matrix), something to avoid in FPGA because it is very time costly.
As I am not expert (yet) on MATLAB HDL coder,nor do I have FPGA boards, I would like to have feedback on the actual implementation of these models.

MATE-SOCS/  Files for reconfigurable Solver-On-Chip for FPGA implementation in HDL-Coder ready format. Using some /FPGA models like machine and converters, the SoC converts Simscape Electrical model in a state-less state-space format (i.e. D matrix used only) and uses HDL Coder to convert to FPGA-ready code.

Much importantly, the SoC solver is a variable-topology, variable parameter solver for FPGA. The advantage of this solver is that the user can change the SimScape topology and element parameter WITHOUT re-generation of a new bitstream. One bitstream to rule them all. There are limitations of course and this the first version.

    -MATE_HDLsolver_myFirstCircuit.slx is a little example with 2-level inverter (energy-compensated), some RLC elements and switched load. One can make parameter and topology modifications on it (in the Simspace reference model). MakeMate2() will then extract parameters and topology to run on the HDL-Coder fixed MATE-SOCS.
    -MATE_HDLsolver_mySecondCircuit.slx is a buck converter with 2-level inverter (energy-compensated), some RLC elements and switched load. One can make parameter and topology modifications on it (in the Simspace reference model). MakeMate2() will then extract parameters and topology to run on the HDL-Coder fixed MATE-SOCS.
    -MATE_HDLsolver_my4thCircuit.slx: more complex... same as myFirst* but with added transformer and in a Buck converter configuration, which is like NOT firing the lower IGBT of a 2-level inverter.
    -MATE MATE_HDLsolver_my5thcircuitPMSMdrive.slx: Boost converter and PMSM vector drive using oversampling inverter. Sufficent to HIL test an electric car! All parameters of the boost and PMSM are parametrizable DURING simulation. In my last version, I included a table-based variable Ldq PMSM.
